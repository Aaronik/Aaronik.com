turn this ip logging thing into a gem!!!

-ditch fingerprinting and stick with raw ips and geo info
-key disappears when sun is moved_aside
-put something spinning behind sun
-add mozilla functionality to site
-once program is loaded, don't load it again.
-'open in github' should spawn new tab, not open in same tab
-nest diff keyframe animation in enclosing div for layered animations
-put pictures in a CDN, will drastically increase speed.
-Any way to loop the songs?
